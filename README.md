A cross platform way to use usbmuxd to service a TCP tunnel for streaming data over.
Written in Swift 5, all credit to https://github.com/jensmeder/DarkLightning for original
work. Has been modified with recent language changes and to distribute over SPM. Will be
adding code to interface from python as well as Combine development hooks to make usage
with SwiftUI more seamless.

> See `Example/` for working implementation.
